- `requests`
- `random`
- `string`

You can install these with pip:

```

## Usage
You can run the script from the command line with the following options:
```bash
python D-archive.org.py -e <email> -p <password> -u <url> -d <dir> -f <file> -r <resolution> -t <threads> -j -m
```  
- `-e`, -`-email`: Your archive.org email (required).
- `-p`, -`-password`: Your archive.org password (required).
- `-u`, -`-url`: Link to the book (e.g., `https://archive.org/details/XXXX`). You can use this argument several times to download multiple books.
- `-d`, -`-dir`: Output directory.
- `-f`, -`-file`: File where the URLs of the books to download are stored.
- `-r`, -`-resolution`: Image resolution (10 to 0, 0 is the highest), default is 3.
- -`t`, -`-threads`: Maximum number of threads, default is 50.
- `-j`, --`jpg`: Output to individual JPGs rather than a PDF.
- `-m`, -`-meta`: Output the metadata of the book to a JSON file (-j option required).

## Example
```bash
python D-archive.org.py -e example@example.com -p password -u https://archive.org/details/book1 -u https://archive.org/details/book2 -d /path/to/output -r 2 -t 10 -j -m
```

This will download the books at the specified URLs from archive.org using the provided email and password, save the individual pages as JPEGs in the specified output directory, use a resolution of 2, use 10 threads for downloading, and output the metadata of the books to JSON files.
